# AES_256-Python
A file encryption tool written with Python 3 using AES-256 bits, scrypt and SHA3-512 algorithms.

AES-Python encrypts|decrypts a file or all files in a folder (even files in subfolders).

# Requirements
- [Pycryptodome](https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

# Usage
Run `python3 AES.py -f [path of the file or folder] -e|d [e for encrypt | d for decrypt]`

and follow instructions on the terminal.

# Explanation
- The AES key is generated by the scrypt key derivation algorithm using the password and a random 32 bytes salt.
- The password is hashed with SHA3-512 with the same salt than the AES-256 key
- Salt, hashed password and the initialisation vector are stored at the beginning of the new encrypted file
- Data of the plain file is encrypted through a 65kb buffer and stored into the new encrypted file
- The plain file is removed

# Warning
Please save your password carefully. You will not be able to retrieve your data otherwise.
